1. Any time you add, remove, or significantly change:
   - Features or modules
   - API endpoints or request/response formats
   - Project structure or directory layout
   - Installation, build, or deployment steps
   - Configuration files or environment variables
   - Major bug fixes, refactoring, or version upgrades

## How to Update ReadMe.md

1. Keep the following sections up to date:
   - Project Overview and Features
   - Technology Stack
   - Directory Structure
   - Installation and Running Instructions
   - API Usage Examples
   - Configuration and Environment Variables
   - Contribution Guidelines
   - FAQ / Troubleshooting
   - Changelog / Update Log
   - Contact or Community Links

2. Ensure all new features, modules, or APIs are documented before merging to main branch.

3. Remove or update any outdated or deprecated information promptly.

4. Use clear, concise, and accurate language. Avoid redundancy and ambiguity.

5. For every Pull Request or code merge, reviewers must check that ReadMe.md is consistent with the codebase.

## Best Practices

- Use markdown formatting for clarity and readability.
- Link to detailed documents (e.g., API docs, developer guides) where appropriate.
- Keep the changelog section updated with every significant release or change.
